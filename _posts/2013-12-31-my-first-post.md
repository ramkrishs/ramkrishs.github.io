## Well, my own blog post

I am Ram, just another computer engineer who works in an IT company.My day typically starts with computer in front of me and half drunk coffee aside.Its been almost two years since i graduated from college with my Bachelor's degree in Computer science.I always had this desire to have a blog and write some random stuff here and there. Thanks to github(http://github.com) and jekyll(https://jekyllrb.com) you guys made my dream come true without spending a single penny. Although i struggled a lot in setting this blog, it was quiet a fun learning new stuff.

Well sometimes i think i am not good at written english. This blogging will help me to improve my skill.At this moment taking this baby step will do.

Happy coding!! Publishing this post proudly using github pages.
